# 📈 Business Recommendations

## Focus on the Top Categories
**Fruits and Vegetables** and **Snack Foods** are the top-performing item types.

✅ **Recommendation**: Launch combo offers, subscription packs, and seasonal promotions like "Buy 1 Get 1 Free" to further boost these categories.

## Improve Visibility of Low-Performing Categories
**Seafood, Breakfast Items**, and **Others** showed the lowest contribution to sales.

✅ **Recommendation**: Increase visibility with banner ads, push notifications, or remove them if consistently underperforming.

## Promote Low Fat Products
**Low Fat** products account for 65% of total sales, showing strong consumer preference.

✅ **Recommendation**: Highlight Low Fat items in health campaigns, especially in metro/Tier 1 areas, with tags like “Most Popular” or “Healthy Choice.”

## Focus on Supermarket Type1 and Tier 3 Outlets
**Supermarket Type1** has the highest revenue and sales volume.
**Tier 3** cities outperform Tier 1 and Tier 2 in revenue.

✅ **Recommendation**: Expand Supermarket Type1 footprint, especially in Tier 3 cities. Prioritize inventory and delivery optimization in these zones.

## Boost Ratings Visibility
Average rating is **3.9**, which is decent, but could be higher.

✅ **Recommendation**: Show high-rated items more prominently. Offer rating-based sorting and incentivize users to leave positive reviews.
